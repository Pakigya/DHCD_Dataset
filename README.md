# DHCD_Dataset
This repository contains the DHCD dataset, a dataset of Devnagari (Nepali) handwritten characters.

## Description

![](https://github.com/Prasanna1991/DHCD_Dataset/blob/master/sample/sample.png?raw=true)

DHCD dataset contains 46 classes [36 character class and 10 digit class] (рдХ .. +  рез .. ) of Devnagari language. Each class
has 2000 images which is divided into two sets: training and test containing 1700 and 300 images respectively. 


## Contributors
The school children of class 6 and 7 (in 2015) from Mount Everest Higher Secondary School, Bhaktapur, Nepal contributed towards this dataset by
volunteering to write the characters which were scanned manually. Beside the manual scanning, other pre-processing tasks were 
also performed, detail of which can be found in the paper.
